4-D Explorer
============

This is just method for projecting 4-D space down into 3-D using perspective
where the origin is always the vanishing point, and projecting the 3-D
projection onto the monitor using a standard isometric method. The
camera currently can pan in 3 dimensions and rotate in all 3-D rotations
such that the direction of the camera never changes.
